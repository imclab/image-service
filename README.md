# Responsive images service

Image resizing proxy for FT responsive images.

**Placeholder repo to speculatively define the service that we might build.  This service doesn't actually work**

## API reference

API endpoints as follows:

### GET /v1/images/`:mode`/`:uri`,`:uri`,â€¦ <br> GET /v1/images/`:mode`?imageset=`:imageset`


Fetch an image or set of images, format and serve them.

        How output should be packaged.
        <dl>
            <dt>raw</dt><dd> Output raw image data.  Requests for multiple images must will be output as a sprite in which the images are tiled in a single horizontal line. Per-image `format` override not available for this output mode (because you can't output an image that is part PNG, part JPEG!)</dd>
            <dt>css-sprite</dt><dd> Output a CSS spritesheet containing the images as data URIs attached to classes with names matching the input identifiers (as closely as possible)</dd>

    <td>URL, imageset</td>
    <td>An URL-encoded URI to use as the image source, e.g. <code>/v1/images/raw/flags%3Agb,http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fimage%2Ejpg</code>. Scheme part of the URI may be omitted if the <code>source</code> property is provided. Alternative to the <code>imageset</code> property.</td>

    <td>Querystring</td>
    <td>
	    Default type of source/scheme in <code>uri</code>s. Custom schemes allow the service to back onto a variety of data sources, including sets of images that may be built into the service itself. Supported source types:

    <td><code>imageset</code></td>
    <td>Querystring</td>
    <td>A JSON array of objects in which each object has a required <code>uri</code> property along with (optionally) other imageset-compatible properties defined on this API. Any property not defined for an individual image will fall back to the value defined for the request (and then to the default, if not defined on the query string). The <code>uri</code> property may include URI without a scheme if <code>source</code> property is provided.</td>

    <td>Compression level for lossy encoding.  May be set to 'lowest', 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'highest', or 'lossless'. If lossless is not supported by chosen image format (JPG), the highest level will be used instead.  Default is medium.</td>

The service stores cached copies of images as retrieved from origin.  Cached copies of transformed images are cached by CDN.

## Examples

Fetch flags of European countries at 40x30px as a CSS sprite

    /v1/images/css-sprite/gb,fr,de,be,es,fi,hu,it,je,lt,no,pl,se?format=png&width=40&height=30&source=flags

Get a headshot of John Gapper at 50px wide in auto-detected image format:

	/v1/images/raw/heads:john.gapper?width=50

Download a set of images for the web app based on their UUIDs, ready-encoded using UTF-hack:

	/v1/images/data-utfhack?source=ftcms&imageset=[{"uri":"48c9d290-874b-11e3-baa7-0800200c9a66"},{"uri":"48c9d291-874b-11e3-baa7-0800200c9a66"}]&format=jpg

Download two flags, John Gapper's headshot, and an FTCMS image, all as data URIs in JSON array in one request

    /v1/images/data?fit=cover&source=flags&imageset=[{"uri":"gb"},{"uri":"fr"},{"uri":"heads:john.gapper","width":50,"height":50},{"uri":"ftcms:48c9d290-874b-11e3-baa7-0800200c9a66"}]

## Restricting use to FT sites

Image requests must contain a `Referer` header with a recognised FT site hostname.
